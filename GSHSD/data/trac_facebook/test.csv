"Doucett Black.  Your atheism is out of place in this Christian Nation in which you live.

Before wasting time dredging up the whole ‚Äúseparation of Church and State‚Äù fallacy, consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:

‚ÄùWe have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.‚Äù

The man who authored our Constitution did not leave any room for doubt about governing ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.  The Congressional records further Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:   

The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. 

‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù

This intent was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù 

The U.S. Almanac, while a respected publication, does not constitute the ultimate authority.  Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the U.S. Constitution, hold such authority.  Their position on the topics at hand is indeed upheld by the Supreme Law of the Land, as evidenced by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Perhaps it is you who is ‚Äústupid‚Äù and needs to educate yourself?",0

For a moment I was stunned; Maybe like many of his passionate supporters. Why would  BJP commit  a harakiri,antagonize minority ,provide a handle for a section of media and opposition to  mount an attack  with renewed vigour and glee( I told u so!) Will it damage its reputation and put a question mark on its developmental agenda?
  But knowing Modi & Amit  Shah,their ability to think far ahead of the rest,I think they have a game plan with far reaching consequence which will pay them rich dividend in the electoral battles down the line.
  Suppose they ensure for the next 2 years a splendid  model of governance   with high growth and  peace  coupled with impartial administration they bury the ghost and tag of 'communal' neutralize and silence the critics once for ever !  If the epitome of  right wing  'monster ' can make this paradigm shift then they will succeed in wooing.the minorities into their fold,which hitherto they have  not been able to.

But then again it shouldnt be turned into a religion/anti religion debate. Its more about public convenience or noise nuisance.,0

Is it a fault that Anna Hazare has acknowledged some of the achievements of Modi. Those who are opposed to the BJP ideologies are supporting the other parties. Do anyone think that Kejriwal is having the right approach to the centre. The massive mandate he got in Delhi was taken for granted by him to abuse others. Is this attitude good for a person like Kejriwal. It is absurd to think that what he says is unquestionable and what he does is right. In my opinion his popularity is showing a downward momentum. Can anyone who is inclined to AAP  show a single political party in India which is having foolproof credentials.,1

"I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.

The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.

When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.

Today i.e. On 23.03.2017 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station.",1

What else is a fascist trait? Going after churches and places of worship? Putting limits on what people can say, even in the privacy of their own homes? Widespread domestic spying? All things done by the Obama administration and yet none of them would think to use the word fascist to describe those 8 years. Then again, until Trump came along, most of them didn't know what the word meant until it became part of the script. ""How to whine on social media in 3 easy steps""",2

"THE SIKH GENOCIDE OF 1984

THE VERDICT DELIVERED IN THE NARODA PATIYA CASE IN THE ANTI MUSLIM GUJARAT RIOTS OF 2002 IS A WELCOME ONE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE I984 SIKH GENOCIDE WHICH HAPPENED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER INDIRA GANDHI BY HER 2 SIKH BODYGUARDS IN RETALIATION FOR OPERATION BLUESTAR, JUSTICE IS YET TO BE DELIVERED. Though Indira Gandhi has been rated by you among the greatest Indians, but I don't feel she has done anything Great to be on this list. We Sikhs don't hold her in high esteem. HOW CAN YOU CALL HER A GREAT INDIAN WHEN SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNACCOUNTED DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT SIKHS WHO ARE A MINORITY COMMUNITY? She only created Bhindranwale to counter the Akalis in Punjab & is responsible for the rise of Religious Extremism in the state AS PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS NO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN PUNJAB. Even after her death, 20,000 Sikhs were murdered all over India (4,000 in Delhi alone) from 31st October till 4th November 1984 in a cold blooded Genocide led by the SECULAR CONRESS PARTY OF INDIA. Sikhs were burnt alive in front of their families, women were gang raped & their property was set on fire. The mobs were laughing as they were killing the Sikhs. The goons were led by local Congress MPS with Govt voter lists in their hands to aid them in finding Sikh houses & properties & were exhorting non Sikhs to kill as many Sikhs as possible. The local Congress MPs even gave the rioters money telling them that the person who will kill the maximum number of Sikhs will get the greatest amount apart from other incentives. From Oct 31 till Nov 3, blood curdling cries of ‚ÄúKHOON KA BADLA KHOON SE LENGE ‚Äì WE WILL AVENGE BLOOD WITH BLOOD‚Äù were broadcast on Delhi Doordarshan & even the renowned actor of Bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan was instigating the people to kill the Sikhs. The Congress was in power at the Centre at the time of the Riots, & P.V.Narasimha Rao was the Home Minister, but he did nothing till Nov 2 despite knowing about the carnage & the Delhi Police just stood as mute spectators instead of protecting the Sikhs & let the bloody carnage to continue as directed by their political masters. Most of the Senior Police Officers deliberately went on leave from Nov 1 to 3 as directed by their political masters.The Army was deliberately not called & were only told to come on the evening of Nov 2, but still there was no one to guide them through the streets of Delhi. Then on Nov 3, after their quench for blood was satisfied, as if by remote control, everything stopped. It was nothing but a cold blooded genocide directed out by the senior Congress politicians against the Sikhs. Had prompt action been taken on the first day of rioting, this Genocide would have never taken place. IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT SHAME FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT STILL THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 1984 SIKH GENOCIDE HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED NOR ANY PROPER LEGAL CONVICTION TAKEN AGAINST EVEN A SINGLE PERSON UNLIKE THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS IN THE 2002 POST GODHRA RIOTS WHICH HAPPENED MUCH LATER DESPITE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE VICTIM‚ÄôS FAMILIES.
The killers & murderers are roaming scot free & some are even ministers in the ruling Congress Govt. NEITHER ANY PROPER COMPENSATION BEEN PAID TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 84 RIOTS, NOR HAS ANY PROPER APOLOGY BEEN GIVEN OR ANY MEMORIAL CONSTRUCTED IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNLESS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES ARE BROUGHT TO BOOK, I WON‚ÄôT BE SURPRISED IF THIS CARNAGE IS AGAIN REPEATED. THE CONGRESS GOVT IS STILL IN DENIAL ABOUT THIS BLOODY CARNAGE AS MANY OF THEIR SENIOR MINISTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GENOCIDE & APART FROM ISSUING HALF HEARTED APOLOGIES WHENEVER IT WAS CONVENIENT TO THEM, THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT DONE ANYTHING AT ALL. THEY ARE HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT BY LIVING IN DENIAL, THEY CAN MAKE PEOPLE FORGET THIS TROUBLED PHASE OF HISTORY, BUT THEY ARE GROSSLY WRONG AS HISTORY NEVER FORGETS ITSELF. UNLESS THE GUILTY ARE NOT BROUGHT TO BOOK, IT WILL LEAD TO A VERY FRUSTRATED & ANGRY GENERATION PRONE TO DRUGS & VIOLENCE.",0

"http://indianexpress.com/.../fatwa-issued-against.../

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"Why India Should #ScrapIndusWatersTreaty
Indus Water Treaty Is Illegal
The case of the 1960 Indus waters treaty, it has been signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and ‚Äúnowhere it is declared that the said agreement/treaty has been signed in the name of the President of India‚Äù, 
‚ÄúAccording to the ministry of external affairs documents, nowhere disclosed agreement has been signed by the Jawaharlal Nehru for the President of India...,‚Äù 

‚ÄúAccording to the impugned agreement 80% water goes to Pakistan which is a serious injury to the fundamental right of the citizens of India coupled with further financial and natural injuries to national interest.‚Äù

If We Indians Keep Quit Today Our Future Generations Will Blame Us And Never Going To Forgive Us

India Need Be Like China Fast And Furious And Must Have Ability To Say On Face.
China Claim South China Sea 
China Made And Develop 7 Artificial Man Made Islands On The South China Sea So Quickly 
Then Why Can't India Stop Water From Our Own States And Union Territories Of India
We Need To Build More Dam On Indus River And Must Have Iccha-Shakti To Say Only One Sentence To World Bank F*ck Off 
India Is Scraping Indus Waters Treaty

If China Can Do For Their Mother Land 
Then Why Not India (If India Cannot Do)
Then Their Is Some Serious Problem In Our Indian Government System With Our Political Partys And Also With Our Useless Politician.
Who Just Know To Bark But Cannot Take Action.

I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

A Baloch Activist Asked Shahrukh Khan For Support On Issue of Pak Atrcoties!! What SRK Did Next Will Make You hate Him Even More

A few hours ago, prominent Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan displayed his tolerance widely on Twitter. He blocked a prominent Baluchistan leader Dr. Mahmud Baloch from following him on Twitter. The reason was simple ‚Äì he had directed a few tweets towards Shah Rukh Khan asking his support to the blazing Baloch issue in Pakistan.

However, instead of helping or simply ignoring him, SRK ‚Äì as he is famously known as ‚Äì chose to put a full stop to him on his virtual media.

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines.

It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).

"The big myth on tax payers in India Data from a Chartered Accountants group.......
Mr Jetly said during his budget speech that we are largely a tax compliant society and presented that only 3.7 crores are  filling ITRs in this poor country with 125 crore population .

The reply by CAs : 

Sir, 
We have 82 crore voters 

- 75% are agriculturists ,61.5 crores ( You exempted them directly but, they can also buy cars , bunglows etc as you quoted.. your political counterparts are also enjoying this) 

Balance..........
20.5 crores 

Less: 24% BPL class ( Below poverty line)

15 crore population ( which is non agriculturist and non BPL) .. 

Less : Senior Citizens, Non working wives, unemployed youths, below taxable income earners...political class..(say 75%) ... in a typical indian family only 1 earning member and 5/6 are dependent on him....

Balance (15-11.25)=3.75 crores is the earning class ... which can file ITRs and ... they are already filling it.... 

.... so almost no gap as Mr Jetly is stressing unnecessarily without knowing his countryü§ìüòùüò±

if Looser Jetly wants more people's to come into tax net ...then... instead foolishly resorting to only rampant raids, surveys...notices... scrutiny ..... demonetisations etc etc terrorism ... he should defy his negative bureaucrats and .......

1. Introduce simple Income Tax on Agricultural Income on large landlords ( Say 10 Acres plus ) - you can add 26% of Agriculturists as tax payers ( Politicians are also enjoying this )

2. Instead of introducing 5000/10000 penalties on late filers of IT return ...
Come out with positive approach and introduce incentives to IT return filers ( learn from Pakistan, IT assessee gets discount in purchase of Car )

3. Introduce Privilege card to  those paying taxes above certain limit.. privilege card to entitle assessee with benefits like Priority quota in railway tickets , Use of airport lounges, subsidised medical facilities, etc etc... *let Tax payers feel proud*

4. Introduce medical insurance / life insurance on basis of average ITR filled... like coverage upto twice of Gross Income in ITR filled for mediclaim and ten times risk cover in case of life insurance 

5. Introduce Pension after 65 yrs of age on the basis of tax paid by tax payer during his working life..

Let honest taxpayers get certain direct benefits.... 

As on today, 3.3% of Indian population is filling ITRs as compared to 8% of China...adding large agriculturists to Income Tax may shoot the figure to more than 10% .... it may help you to cool your tax terrorism mindset and a tax compliant nation ...üòä

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù

Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, ‚ÄúI eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.‚Äù
Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, ‚ÄúThe cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‚ÄòShraddha‚Äô of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.‚Äù

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000
ICICI bank: 110-120
SBI: 95-105

Google ""Shemitah Year 2016"" we are headed for the biggest blobal recession yet.
You have the opportunities to either become rich or become poor. 

Sit on cash don't buy anything right now.
Until, we reach the above Targets, you should sit on cash.

"Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake.",2

"USA, UK, GERMANY, FRANCE and many other countries follow state religion, while they allow other faiths to coexist. However laws of the land are strictly followed regardless of ones religion and no concessions are given. None of the Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Iran, etc., have churches or temples but in the guise of secularism India has given Muslim followers unlimited liberties of loud sparks for their calls to prayers, subsidies to travel to Macca Madina and various other financial helps. Yet this community, many of them, are dissatisfied. In that case Indian govt should allow them to migrate to Pakistan Banladesh or any other. Muslim country which will take them. Those who support secularism, can also try and emigrate to other countries of their choice if they will be accepted. Creators of constitution have committed biggest blunder and its interpreters of this secularism are propagating this blunder to help their vote bank which is a great shame.",1

"Sub:- Like of 29/11 attacks can‚Äôt be stopped without solving Kashmir problem which can‚Äôt be solved without end-game in sight. 

-----In the entire history of mankind it will be difficult to find another example where a country like India [of six times than Pakistan especially India with better level of advance in science & technology as is evident from ‚ÄòMangal-yan‚Äô the Mars mission] cowardly & helplessly tolerates repeated humiliation by way of armed aggression on it. India is facing such shameful situation for the simple reason that like Pakistan (and Bangladesh) India too foolishly does not understand that the last word on India‚Äôs partition is yet to be written.  

One more matter agitates a person like me born before independence and that too in Kota region of my native State of Rajasthan. We were brought up in a culture where a ‚ÄòSainik‚Äô laying down his life in a war was considered getting ‚ÄòMoksha‚Äô through ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô [and we were told the stories of Rani Padmini and other ladies of Chittorgarh becoming ‚ÄòSati‚Äô because their husbands got ‚ÄòVeergati‚Äô in battle and Hada Rani (from Kota - Bundi given in marriage to Chittorgarh) cutting her head and sending it as a memento to her ‚Äòmadhosh‚Äô husband in order to motivate him to fight the battle against enemy and Rana Pratap never submitting to Akabar rather preferred to live in jungles while incessantly fighting to recover the lost forts and mother-land]. 

This culture has still remained but when  nowadays I see the soldiers and their officers dying (not in war against Pakistan) but like ‚Äòkeede-makode‚Äô (insects) and at the top of it are called ‚ÄòShaheed‚Äô (Martyrs), I get confused whether the culture in which we were brought up was right or the present culture ? (where as a Veteran Colonel said after 29/11 on a TV program that after training of merely 3 to 4 months Jihadi under the very nose of security forces at border etc come from Pakistan and kill the well and extensively trained & groomed Indian soldiers and their officers at Army camp / Corps headquarters)  

But in any case, it is high time GOI realizes that earlier Congress party and now BJP headed by PM Modi and all other political parties in India have been and are incapable of solving Kashmir problem due to their communal mindset. Therefore before it is too late GOI should spare a meager amount of $ 4,400 for the launch of ‚ÄòUnited India Party‚Äô which alone can solve Kashmir and other problems being faced by India. 

It is hoped that the Friends-of-India will constrain GOI to see reason as explained at:-     

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/At-least-after-29-11-friends-should-advice-India-to-spend--4400-to-solve-Kashmir-problem_a45603.html 

[Especially given the fact that India should not waste this opportunity where some Kashmiri Muslims are showing courage and patriotism to start office (with flag and board / banner) of pro-India national political party in Srinagar and in other parts of the valley where the writ of government of J&K and India does not run and on the contrary Pakistan supported Separatists have been able to inflict almost five months of shutdown on the people of Kashmir]

3) immediately enforce BTT ( Bank transaction tax which should not. E more than 2% of the value used.

"Some suggestions
1) Like aadhar card make it mandatory to have ATM/Debit Card.
2)Every business outlet small or big shall have swiping machines/paytm like arrangement. It must be made mandatory to run business.
3)Stop printing Rs.2000/_ immediately. And in future Rs.500/- . If not demonitize them six months before every election. All elections hence shall be conducted on the same date henceforth.
4)like indirect taxes integration, integrate all direct taxes & collect them through transaction tax from bank as arthakranti suggested. 
5) Continue cash withdrawal restrictions even after Dec 31st. 2016. Reduce cash usage eventually and limit to Rs.5000/- per month to individuals and Rs.20000/- to 100000/- to businesses as per their turnover.
6) Gst shall be collected at first billing. Stop input credit and collect turnover tax basing on turnover of distribution, service providers, and other small businesses.

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/ 

 Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake. Dear Indian Express,

"Welcome Sir
Please kindly make it convenient to be spared my experiences as a Self Employed Er. Entrepreneur :
My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some technical reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chronicle, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.

"I would like to mention here that about a month ago, I bought a car Vitara Breeza ZDI from One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005, having Vehicle Registration No. UP 32 HQ 5615.

The very next days after delivery of the car, I noticed some cloudy parts and bubbles on the driver and co-driver door of the car. then I spoke to the car dealership about the problem they notice the problem and send my car to their Maruti Suzuki Authorised service station on 02-01-2017 for fixing the problem.

After 15 days, the same problem was reoccurred. When I took my car to the Dealer (One-up Motors (Maruti Suzuki), Alambagh, Lucknow ‚Äì 226005) they again sent it to service station for rectification of the problems and delivered the car to me after two days.

The same problem has again been noticed on 13-02-2017. After just 20 days  again i.e. 24-02-17 the same problem has been noticed on the entire body of the car.

When I visit again the authorised service station of the dealership they refused to resolve the problem and misbehaved with me.

Today i.e. On 23.03.207 My car is still under repair with Oneup Moters Arambagh from last 20 days.

I brought the car for use my old parents and not to send it repeatedly to the service station for repairs or fixing problems. My father is suffering from heart ‚ù§ problems. As you know it is very difficult to senior citizens or to repeatedly visit the service station.",1

"Sub:- (i)- Before (Ret) High Court Judge a lady dies in Hospital due to non-availability of NEW currency (ii)- Law should be same for all. The Govt & RBI should be prosecuted for causing deaths by negligence u/s 304 A IPC etc

--- On November, 25 evening on a business TV channel ‚Äòmagic bricks NOW‚Äô one of the panelist Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha said that in his housing society at Mumbai a lady had heart problem hence her family members and neighbors [including Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha] took her to a nearest private hospital but she died because her family did not have new cash currency to meet the demand of the hospital. 

A negligent driver is prosecuted and punished for killing a person by car / truck. The organizers / management of public functions / utilities are prosecuted and punished in case of fire due to negligence in which people get killed. Similarly the authorities / officials of Government and Reserve Bank of India should also be prosecuted and punished for negligence about demonetization which has allegedly killed ~ 70 persons, as mentioned at:- 

http://www.alwihdainfo.com/Opposition-protecting-Government-and-RBI-from-prosecution-under-Section-304-A-IPC-etc_a45304.html   

It is expected that Justice (Ret) M F Saldanha will take this matter to its logical / legal end and would get justice to the victim and her family, relatives and friends by getting the GOI & RBI (and hospital authorities) prosecuted for negligence etc about illegal demonetization program which has caused this death of the lady.

In our opinion we are on a brink of a global collapse there will be a cyclical recession in the time period of 2016-2018.

Global events that will exacerbate the recession:

- IMF's Foreign Reserve basket adds Chinese Yuan to its Forex basket reducing Euro's contribution to this basket by a considerable 7%+
- Euro will considerable depreciate 
- BREXIT - British Voters will actually vote for Britain to leave the EU
- US Elections and it's uncertainty.
- Crude Oil Glut
- China Debt-to-Equity conversion 
- Shemitah year of 2016

A Major global sell off should have happened on 2 October 2016 but as that is a Sunday on 3 October 2016, which is a Monday we will witness a global sell off and Global markets will correct in excess of 8%+ 

Targets in the range on 2016-2018
(All prices are in Rupees

Sensex: 18000-19000
Nifty: 6200-6400
Bank Nifty:8500-9000

"Cow in Hinduism:

Eating Beef (Cow Mata) allowed in Hinduism.
Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, ‚ÄúOn the occasion of a girl‚Äôs marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.‚Äù 
Rigveda (6/17/1) states that ‚ÄúIndra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.‚Äù 
Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, ‚ÄúIt is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.‚Äù

"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fatwa-issued-against-reality-singing-star-nahid-afrin-by-42-clerics-4569825/

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa). 
We expect apology from your side for such a mistake",2

The Hamoodur Rahman Commission set up by the Pakistani government following the war noted various atrocities committed by the Pakistani military, including widespread arson and killings in the countryside, killing of intellectuals and professionals, killing of Bengali military officers and soldiers on the pretence of mutiny, killing Bengali civilian officials, businessmen and industrialists, raping numerous Bengali women as a deliberate act of revenge, retaliation and torture, deliberate killing of members of the Bengali Hindu minority and the creation of mass graves.[200] The Hamoodur Rahman Commission wrote, ""indiscriminate killing and looting could only serve the cause of the enemies of Pakistan. In the harshness, we lost the support of the silent majority of the people of East Pakistan.... The Comilla Cantonment massacre (on 27th/28th of March, 1971) under the orders of CO 53 Field Regiment, Lt. Gen. Yakub Malik, in which 17 Bengali Officers and 915 men were just slain by a flick of one Officer's fingers should suffice as an example"".

"What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

Erdoƒüan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoƒüan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

Under Erdoƒüan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

Erdoƒüan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016 1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil. Indian fooled by Saffron gay gangsters government",2

Dear Indian Express,
I feel sorry to write that your journalists are out there to misinterpret events and present them in a distorted manner just to make some sensational headlines. The news about upcoming singer Nahid Afreen has been prepared without proper research and investigation. It was very sad to see that your journalists don't even know the difference between fatwa and appeal. 
A fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion issued only by a qualified jurist (Mufti) on a request by someone who is unable to understand religious guidelines whereas the leaflet that is being circulated and presented as Fatwa is just a hard copy of an appeal signed by 46 men who believe in religious practices. The merit of appeal can be discussed on many grounds and in many dimensions but first and foremost, an appeal can not be called a legal opinion (Fatwa).
